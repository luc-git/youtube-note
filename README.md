# Youtube-note

Youtube-note is twitter notes implementation for youtube.

## How it works?

Youtube-note will add a box under the video description and will check each second (when the video is playing) in a database if there is a note for the video you are watching. If there is not note the box will remain blank

## Where is the database?

The database is hosted on [dolthub](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/luc-dolt/note/data/main)
